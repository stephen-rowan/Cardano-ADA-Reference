# NFT-DAO NFT metadata standards

https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/NFT-DAO-NFT-metadata-standards/341012-48088

## Problem statement :

NFT use cases have varied metadata needs and schemas. We lack standards for alike NFTs to avoid complex, fragile systems & chaos at scale.
Describe your solution to the problem

We'll engage industry experts to identify or define standards, work with IOG and industry consortiums to document NFT metadata standards.
Relevant experience

Engineers skilled in standards bodies and marketing team used to collaborating in standard develoment.

### Define Metadata Standards for NFTs on Cardano
************************************************
NFT use cases have varied metadata needs and schemas

Defining universally acceptable standards is no small task

We will engage industry experts to identify and define standards

We will engage with industry consortiums

We intent to document NFT metadata standards

We will make an easy-to-use user interface for adding the metadata to NFTs

## PLAN AND BUDGET

* **Phase 1** - Research all the metadata standards and models across the existing marketplaces
(In process already within NFT-DAO working groups)

* **Phase 2** - Create a draft RFC (request for comment) document for review by larger community (Join and participate in consortiums and working group in industry and with IOG engineering)

* **Phase 3** - Formalize all the best practices collected - (Test it in the real world with actual users and Publish the final work)

* **Phase 4** - Finalize the Documentation into a simple user interface wireframe - (We will create the wireframes, the UI development will need to be done in Fund 5)

Total: $28,648

## DETAILED PLANS AND PROGRESS TO DATE

We have already started working on this within the NFT-DAO:

Problem: We see tens or potentially hundreds of projects all rushing to create their own NFTs with varying metadata for their own needs depending on the use case trying to be the first to market. We don't see this is scalable as eventually there might be different metadata schemas for the same type of art piece or real estate property for example.

* Much like IOG, NFT-DAO will talk with experts from their industry to help create NFT standards that can best follow existing standards in each market

 

* After creating the NFT standard per industry, say art for example, it will be released in a RFC to the greater community and then eventually voted on using NFT-DAO (community, experts, governance token?) while prototyping in NFT-DAO's BOXCAR.

 

## SCHEDULE AND FUNDING
We have a comprehensive plan and schedule you can visit outside of IdeaScale. Currently IdeaScale isn't flexible for managing a living document. Please go to this link for the complete plan and deliverables: http://bit.ly/samemeta

PARTNERING FOR SUCCESS WITH EXPERTS

We will partner our strong developers with the experts at the IOG Professional Services and MuNk.io engineers for the fastest paths to success.
