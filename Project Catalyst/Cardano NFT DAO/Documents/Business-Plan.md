**Our Projects**

**NFT-DAO (THE RAILS) -- A Comprehensive NFT Framework**

The NFT-DAO is a community, governance and organisational framework upon
which future NFT platforms can be peer-produced for the Cardano
blockchain. The purpose of the NFT-DAO is to support the social,
economic and technical infrastructure for NFT solutions on Cardano.

**NFT PLATFORM (THE BOX-CAR) -- An NFT Market Platform for Cardano**

The NFT BOXCAR (working title) is one of the technical solutions
supported by the NFT-DAO, that seeks to build a composable NFT Market
platform on the Cardano blockchain. The purpose of the NFT BOXCAR is to
allow users to easily develop, tokenise and launch NFT products on
Cardano.

[]{#_Hlk64616059 .anchor}**Our Mission**

NFT-DAO will support a collaborative economy by mobilizing P2P networks
and building a composable NFT 'Shopify' platform to stimulate user and
developer growth on the Cardano blockchain.

**OUR PROBLEM**

42 Project Catalyst proposals address NFT point solutions---yet we lack
an overarching DApp strategy to dominate as the de facto NFT platform
choice.

**OUR SOLUTION**

We will coordinate an NFT-DAO that implements all NFT Dapp requirements
to build a penultimate composable NFT Framework on Cardano.

**OUR CONTEXT**

With a community composed of avid Cardano supporters, NFT-DAO has
positioned the project within the systematic and research-driven context
of the Cardano blockchain project. With Cardano's Project Catalyst now
identified as the largest decentralised fund in the world, the NFT-DAO
is also positioned at the forefront of community-driven NFT development
within the project. We seek to align our mission with the broader
Cardano and Project Catalyst missions, which include principles of code,
community and commercialisation \[[1](#Sources)\].

**Our Vision**

**NFT-DAO VISION STATEMENT**

NFT-DAO envisions an open-source composable NFT framework for
all---instead of multiple point solutions only benefiting some.

NFT-DAO envisions a comprehensive NFT strategy and open-source framework
that enables all users (technical and non-technical) to easily deploy
industry specific tokenized asset marketplaces.

We seek an organized community effort to fully define comprehensive
requirements for the penultimate NFT platform of any blockchain and
build it as a Cardano asset anyone can use to build their specialized
marketplaces or NFT solutions upon.

We can build better together.

**HIGH LEVEL CONCEPT**

NFT-DAO will support a collaborative culture by mobilizing P2P networks
and tokenizing a composable NFT framework to increase socio-economic
sovereignty for the Cardano community. The NFT-DAO and NFT BOXCAR will
achieve this by focusing on the following three pillars:

> [Collaborative Culture (Community) \| Mastery]{.ul}\
> Mobilizing P2P networks to deliver NFT products on Cardano.
>
> [Shared Governance (Code) \| Passion]{.ul}**\
> **Increasing socio-economic sovereignty for constituents through
> codified DAO governance.
>
> [Incentivized Innovation (Commercialization) \| Revenue]{.ul}**\
> **Tokenizing contributions within a composable NFT Framework on the
> Cardano blockchain.

It is envisioned that the development of the NFT-DAO as a collaborative
culture with shared governance and incentivised innovation embedded,
will: 1) provide individuals and communities with greater opportunities
to build and launch NFT marketplaces on Cardano; 2) build a dedicated
and self-organising community of NFT developers and entrepreneurs within
Project Catalyst; 3) refine and leverage collective intelligence as a
problem-solving strategy with specific and broad applications --
including functionality and interoperability issues cross-chain; 4)
contribute to a holistic strategy for multiple NFT use-case deployments;
and 5) share governance and contribution equity with participants across
the DAO and its contributor network.

The network effect of these outcomes is to increase global
socio-economic sovereignty and efficacy.

[]{#OurRationale .anchor}**Our Rationale**

As growth and competition within the Catalyst community increases, we
feel it imperative that we as a community consider how to collectively
and strategically align our efforts to generate greater synergy: where
the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. We feel this is not
only a unique selling point for this proposal within Cardano\'s NFT
space, but also for Cardano as a social, financial and governance
infrastructure.

Our rationale for this approach lies in the open and decentralized ethos
of Project Catalyst, Cardano and blockchain technology: We can build
better together.

Of the 188 fund-seeking proposals for Project Catalyst Fund 3, we
identified NFT\'s as a core area of interest within the Catalyst
community, and an area of major growth within the blockchain economy at
large. Based on a hashtag search for \#NFT within Catalyst, 42 proposals
(22.34% of fund-seeking proposals within the Dapp Creation and Developer
Ecosystem categories) identified an aspect of NFT\'s as being applicable
to their project (an analysis of these proposals is included further
down). In contrast, **at the Assessment phase of Project Catalyst's Fund
4, NFT proposals had climbed to 126, or a 66% increase from Fund 3. Of
the 339 total proposals in Fund 4, proposals involving elements of NFT's
are present in 37% of total proposals.**

According to data from cryptoart.io, the NFT art-space as a whole has
seen over \$382 million in total sales volume since April 2018 with the
majority of growth occurring in 2021. These sales involved 139,343
artwork sales at an average of 2,795 per sale. In February 2021,
\$98.48M worth of crypto-art was sold (or 25.78% of total all-time
sales) where \$75.26M (76.42%) of these sales were made on Nifty
Gateway. In March 2021, \$131.48M worth of crypto-art was sold (or
34.42% of total all-time sales) where \$93.1M (70.8%) of these sales
were made on Nifty Gateway \[[2](#Sources)\]. Two staggering figures
that arise from this are that **in February and March 2021, crypto-art
sales have exceeded all crypto-art sales to date.** Secondly, since
March 2020 (when total crypto-art sales were at \$350,360), **there has
been a 37,427% increase in crypto-art sales.** (These figures do not
include the many NFT use-cases outside of crypto art, including non-art
collectibles).

Because of the dominance of crypto-art in the NFT space, NFT-DAO have
decided to target our first MVP platform toward the NFT art market.

**COMPETITIVE EDGE**

The reasons this project may be more successful than other solutions is:

1.  [Vision]{.ul} - A macro NFT strategy and DAO will better support the
    sustainable development of NFT community growth, use, DApp
    development and tokenization on Cardano than through the limitations
    of individual competition.

2.  [Collectivism]{.ul} - Each individual NFT project is better served
    by the collective experience of the community (as is the case with
    Project Catalyst itself), rather than being limited by the
    experience of one individual or team alone;

3.  [Effectiveness]{.ul} - For NFT proposals that will not be successful
    in this or future funding rounds, due to a cap on the amount of
    funds available, NFT proposers will be able to contribute ongoing
    value rather than be overlooked;

[]{#OurValues .anchor}**Our Values**

**NFT-DAO VALUES**

The values of the NFT-DAO are embedded in our three pillars:

1.  We value the Inclusivity, Empathy and Willingness of Collaborative
    Culture;

2.  We value the Transparency, Equality and Sovereignty of Shared
    Governance;

3.  We value the Equity, Proactivity and Sustainability of Incentivized
    Innovation.

**OUR ETHOS AND PURPOSE**

NFT-DAO is a community originating from inside the Cardano Catalyst DAO
with our primary focus to support NFT development on Cardano. We're an
emergent DAO - in formation - and an NFT bridge to user-markets and
communities outside of Catalyst and Cardano. We aspire to:

-   Holonic architecture;

-   Heterarchical communication;

-   Autonomous Cooperative behaviour;

-   Chaordic systems thinking.

Our structure is emerging as the embodiment of purpose, principles and
people. As such, our ethos and purpose is being captured in the form of
a charter, constitution and a certificate of incorporation and bylaws
capable of creating legal reality in an appropriate jurisdiction\*. The
charter will detail our organisational structure, conceptual
relationships, details of eligibility, ownership, voting, bodies, and
methods of governance. It is the contract of rights and obligations
between all participants in the community.\
\
*\*As of March 10 2021, the NFT-DAO is registered as 'NFT DAO-LLC' under
Wyoming state legislature, which passed the DAO bill (SF0038)*
\[[3](#Sources)\] *that will be voted on by the senate in July 1 2021.*

**Our Goals**

Our general goals are:

1)  To increase user adoption on the Cardano blockchain;

2)  To increase NFT development on the Cardano blockchain, and;

3)  To build a collaborative (open-sourced) economy to support these
    goals.

Our specific goals are:

> [NFT-DAO]{.ul}: to mobilize the Project Catalyst community to
> stimulate NFT development.
>
> [NFT BOXCAR]{.ul}: to build a composable NFT 'Shopify' platform on the
> Cardano blockchain.

[]{#_Hlk64616171 .anchor}**Our Roadmap**

The NFT-DAO Roadmap is loosely built around the Five Stages of Business
Lifecycle \[[4](#Sources)\], which include: 1) Seed and Development, 2)
Start-up, 3) Growth and Establishment, 4) Expansion and 5) Maturity.
However, since we are a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation, our model
will also include phased decentralisation, so that our roadmap will
begin with a more centralised decision-making and organisational model
until more robust systems of shared governance are developed and
implemented. It is intended that the Maturity phase of the DAO will
include full decentralisation and community governance of the DAO, as
patterned after the decentralisation pathway of Cardano. Our roadmap
will be based around the funding of developmental phases within the
business lifecycle, including the micro-projects within each of those
phases.

**[STAGE 1: SEED & DEVELOPMENT \| Q1-Q2 2021]{.ul}**

**NFT-DAO PROJECT CATALYST FUND 3 DELIVERABLES \| \$48,965**

It is estimated that funding for the seed and development stage of the

# **1. NFT-DAO'S BOXCAR** **\| \$39,648**

[Intro & Mission]{.ul}

BOXCAR is the product imagined by NFT-DAO.  Our mission is to deliver a
rapid NFT marketplace generation DApp on Cardano.  

[Who's It For?]{.ul}

1.  Creators - Those looking to create a marketplace to sell their
    creative and intellectual property as NFTs;

2.  Investors - Those looking to invest in NFTs ranging from art and
    digital collectibles to licensable intellectual property and more;

3.  Lurkers - People that just want to browse and are maybe not quite
    ready to buy.

[Why Build It?]{.ul}

1.  NFTs are in the midst of explosive growth;

2.  There is no NFT solution/framework for Cardano;

3.  NFTs on ETH are expensive;

4.  NFT-DAO is doubling in size week over week;

5.  NFT creation and auctions will thrive on a low fee decentralized
    network like Cardano;

6.  A universally set of NFT standards will ensure NFT interoperability
    on Cardano.

[What Is It?]{.ul}

Boxcar is the Shopify of NFT marketplaces built on Cardano.  It will
allow people to quickly create niche based NFT marketplaces.

[Glossary]{.ul}

1.  MintMarketplace - creates a marketplace;

2.  MintCollection - creates a collection;

3.  MintNFT - creates an NFT inside of a collection;

4.  Burn - Burns NFT;

5.  Sell - list an NFT to be sold on marketplace through auction.

[User Types]{.ul}

1.  Owners - people who want to create marketplaces;

2.  Creators - people who want to create NFTs;

3.  Sellers - people who want to sell NFTs;

4.  Buyers - people who want to buy NFTs.

Figure: NFT-DAO BOXCAR concept (Rich Kopcho & Andy Shaw, NFT-DAO)

[Marketplace View]{.ul}

The marketplace view displays NFTs that are available for sale through
auction.  It should find a balance in promoting established NFT creators
while giving space for unknown NFT creators to be discovered.

[NFT View]{.ul}

The NFT View will provided detailed information on the NFT up for
auction and should include the following:

-   Ownership history, includes generation event;

-   Current auction price / most recent bid;

-   Time left in auction;

-   Detailed and zoomed in view of imagery;

-   Link to creator of NFT;

-   Information on the current seller of NFT;

-   History of NFT ownership;

-   Rarity of NFT.  1 of 1 or many of many;

-   Share to social button;

-   Connect Wallet button.

[User Profile View]{.ul}

The User View will provide the following information

-   Name;

-   Showcase/showroom button;

-   Handle;

-   Profile picture;

-   NFTs created;

-   NFTs sold;

-   Wallet address;

-   Share to social button;

-   Connect Wallet button.

[Registration]{.ul}

This is dependent on Yoroi and other wallet / metamask alternatives
native to Cardano.  Need more info from IOG and open collaboration
between all builders on Cardano. If there Yoroi can connect to DApps,
then registration should be accomplished by connecting wallet through
the Connect Wallet button

[Use Cases]{.ul}

# **2. DEV ECOSYSTEM \| \$63,842**

# [DEV TEAM BUILD OUT PLAN]{.ul}

[Overview]{.ul}

As NFT-DAO builds out and the vision of the product starts to solidify,
we will aim to balance the urgency of immediate tasks with inclusive
processes of the DAO structure. Questions arising include:

-   How do we fast-track a product in an environment that is inherently
    self-organising? (Phase 1, 2);

-   At the same time, how do we maintain the ethos of
    Catalyst/Cardano/DAO where anyone can voice their opinions, openly
    share ideas, and most of all, contribute to the project once IP\'s
    start coming in? (Phase 2, 3).

The goal of this plan is to outline the current needs of the project in
lead up to further development funding rounds, and to be able to quickly
onboard and triage new developers as they arrive into the DAO community.
The development team aims to build out in three phases:

-   [Phase 1]{.ul} - Will employ a leadership model within a pool of
    contracted devs. and volunteer/catalyst devs. with a focus on
    contracting;

-   [Phase 2]{.ul} - Will expand the dev. pool with a focus on
    volunteers. In addition, a strong focus on documentation, education,
    and onboarding will be set in place to allow for ease of
    contribution. During this phase, we will roll out one team with the
    goal of working on smaller community features;

-   [Phase 3]{.ul} - Will be to expand the community feature teams. More
    detail per phase can be seen below.

## [Phase 1]{.ul}

We will triage experienced senior developers to lay the groundwork.
These will include three teams that may change in Phase 2 or 3 as we
build out. Developers will be free to join, but clear vetting and
onboarding processes will need to be developed to onramp new devs. from
Project Catalyst and abroad. Initial teams will include:

### Dev Ops

-   1 developer (contract/catalyst);

-   NFT-DAO Community devs.

### Front End

-   \[crucial\] 1-2 full-time senior full-stack engineer (contract);

-   \[crucial\] 1-2 front end engineer (contract);

-   NFT-DAO Community devs.

### Blockchain

-   External partners (IOG, MuKn);

-   NFT-DAO Community devs.

[Phase 2]{.ul}

After an MVP is complete, we can begin inviting more developers from
catalyst/community into the codebase. There will be code for reference
and we will begin focusing more on documentation so that we can triage
new developers while growing adoption and consensus on NFT standards. We
will also create more teams focused on open-source code. An IP strategy
will also need to be implemented that considers team access to
potentially confidential WIP code/products. The first \"test\" team to
work on features governed by community interest will be formed here, as
well as integrating a governance token into the MVP.

### Dev Ops

-   +1 developer (contract/catalyst)

### Front End

-   +X developers

### Blockchain

-   \[crucial\] Representative from IOG

### Community Feature Team \[test\]

-   1 dev lead from phase 1

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   All NFT-DAO Community devs.

### Governance Token

-   Likely contractors or strong blockchain developers

-   Migrate 1 IOG member from phase 1 blockchain team to facilitate
    > smooth integration with Phase 1

## [Phase 3]{.ul}

The community led team will work on features voted on by the community.
The \"core\" team will focus on helping brands/IPs build on the boxcar:

### Dev Ops

-   +1 developer (contract)

### Front End

-   +X developers

### Blockchain

-   +1 developer (holon lead) owns/maintains work

-   +1 developer for any outstanding improvements that needs to be made

## **3. NFT METADATA STANDARDS \| \$28,648**

NFT use cases have varied metadata needs and schemas. We lack standards
for alike NFTs to avoid complex, fragile systems & chaos at scale.
NFT-DAO will engage industry experts to identify or define standards and
work with IOG and industry consortiums to document NFT metadata
standards. To do so, we will employ engineers, organisations and teams
skilled in collaborating on standard development.

We see tens or potentially hundreds of projects all rushing to create
their own NFTs with varying metadata for their own use-cases, trying to
be the first to market. We don\'t see this as a scalable or
collaborative approach, as eventually there might be different metadata
schemas for the same types of art, digital collectible or real estate
property for example.

-   Patterned after IOG, NFT-DAO will talk with experts from their
    industry to help create NFT standards that can best follow existing
    standards in each market;

-   After creating the NFT standard per industry (ie, art), the
    community can then prototype in NFT-DAO\'s BOXCAR;

-   Community voting can also be conducted after expert appraisals, to
    support use of NFT standards per industry or royalty splits for any
    stakeholders involved.

**[STAGE 3: GROWTH & ESTABLISHMENT \| Q4 2021 - Q1 2022]{.ul}**

**NFT-DAO PROJECT CATALYST FUND 6-8 DELIVERABLES**

In the Growth & Establishment Stage, the NFT-DAO will look at
establishing a staged token distribution model within the DAO including
formalising a governance voting system; a tiered community-engagement
approach (see Our Structure section); the employment of tokenization
strategies for IP including Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS);
seeking funding and developing team projects to support platform market
growth; research and development of NFT use-cases and markets outside of
crypto-art; stream-lining community onboarding and organisational
management within the DAO itself; testing a community proposal and
voting process; social media and sales funnels; and aligning with
developments within Cardano and Project Catalyst that support Identity
Management, metadata standards, DeFi and native asset management and
exchange.

**[STAGE 4: EXPANSION \| Q2-Q4 2022]{.ul}**

**NFT-DAO SELF-FUNDED DELIVERABLES**

In the Expansion Stage, the NFT-DAO will look at formally transitioning
into a more fully decentralised model of community participation through
weighted governance voting (based on levels of community participation);
encouraging a self-sustainable collaborative economy with a fee
structure supported by marketplaces and products launched on the DAO
framework; streamlining actions and outcomes from community proposal
generation and voting processes; community funding micro-projects within
the DAO; seeking cross-chain partnerships and interoperability; seeking
expansion funding and revenue such as a DAO stake-pool equity; new
service offerings such as an NFT exchange; public education programs and
exchange agent-models. We will also move into larger geographical
markets and explore broader NFT markets beyond art, including
collectibles, virtual assets, in-game assets, credentials, event
tickets, physical art, real estate, music, video, social media, and
industries.

**[STAGE 5: MATURITY \| 2023+]{.ul}**

**NFT-DAO SELF-FUNDED DELIVERABLES**

In the Maturity Stage of the NFT-DAO development, we aim to operate as a
fully decentralised DAO in alignment with NFT market maturation. This
includes being a market cap leader in NFT launch and growth on Cardano;
an authority on NFT public education; maturation as a functional and
viable DAO organisation and template for other DAO's; positioning as a
top five NFT market leader in the blockchain space; supporting the
ongoing adoption and implementation of NFT use-case on Cardano;
establishing a holistic collaborative economic platform with a mechanism
to support mass-innovation of NFT-related initiatives and products;
establishment of a holistic organisational model; and investing in and
leveraging global innovations, governance and financial systems as
driven by Cardano.

**Our Story**

Producing the WyoHackathon (2017-Present) brought Rich Kopcho (USA:
Entrepreneur) into close relationship with the Cardano, IOHK and Emurgo
community and teams. From his history of open-sourcing projects, he
noticed a level of professionalism behind the Cardano project that he
felt compelled to support more fully at a personal level. He submitted
WyoHackathon's IOHK challenges in October 2020 through the Project
Catalyst program. Since he was producing the hackathon, he didn't
propose anything until Fund 3. Rich wanted to support the decentralised
funding model by contributing proposals and learning how the processes
and community operated. He added several items in the Fund3 Ideas stage,
including a Dapp Creation proposal for a Comprehensive NFT Framework
Collab \[[5](#Sources)\]. Since this proposal resonated with other NFT
proposers, it began drawing enough interest to build a dedicated NFT
community from within Project Catalyst.

Rich's proposed project was soon joined by Tyler Wales (USA: Product
Management), Troy Egan (New Zealand: Peer Production) and Finley
McIlwaine (USA: Blockchain Programming) who supported in the development
of the Fund3 proposal and community building via social channels.
Wilhelm Horrix (USA), Sofi Heessen (Central Europe), Michael Yagi (USA),
Alessandro (Germany) and Phil (Australia) would begin the formation of a
Developer Holon, while Azeez & Farooq (Ireland) from the SoMint art
market project, and artists Andy (New Zealand), Rares & Ana (Romania)
and Chloe (Australia) would join the Marketing Holon. In a little over
two months, the NFT-DAO has grown to a Discord community of over 200
developers, artists, marketers, specialists and enthusiasts.

COMMUNITY MAKE-UP**

An initial snapshot of the NFT-DAO community (dated February 25 2021)
identified 47 members grouped into four categories: 1) The Founding
Holon (4 members, 8.5%), 2) The Development Holon (15 members, 31%); 3)
The Marketing Holon (10 members, 21%) and 4) The Unknown Holon (18
members,38%) with skills unknown. Amongst the Development Holon, it was
identified that 4 members were functional programmers, 5 members were
programmers with blockchain experience and 6 programmers ranged across
programming skillsets. In the Marketing Holon, it was identified that 5
members were digital artists, 5 worked in film and video production and
4 worked in branding and marketing. Of the community, 14 members (29%)
were onboarded to the NFT-DAO from Project Catalyst, either by merging
their proposals or showing a desire to join the DAO.

In the month since this initial snapshot was taken, the NFT-DAO now has
115 members joining the DAO's Discord-based community (59% growth). The
primary holons of the DAO now cover Business, Content, Design,
Development, Governance, Product, Marketing and UX/UI. Each holon has a
holon leader attached, with smaller content-specific holons forming
around them through Discord discussion channels.

**COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS**

[Synopsis of Catalyst NFT Proposals]{.ul}

1.  NFT use cases primarily fell into three categories: a) Digital
    Asset, b) Intellectual Property Representation, c) Physical World
    Asset Representation;

2.  Majority of proposals intend to build both minting functionality and
    their unique marketplace or use case;

3.  Total treasury cost to fund proposals can be significantly reduced
    if majority of proposers focus on building their unique use case /
    marketplace, while we build out comprehensive modular minting
    solution.

[Detailed Analysis of Catalyst NFT Proposals]{.ul}

Based on the collation of 42 total Project Catalyst proposals tagged as
\#NFT at the date of writing, it was found that 27 proposals had
non-fungible tokens as a substantial part of the proposals offering.
From a spot analysis of these 27 proposals, four NFT groupings were
identified as having direct similarity with other proposals and another
five groupings were identified as having an indirect similarity with
other proposals on the platform. Of the groupings with direct
similarities -- where proposals shared the same idea - four proposals
were for an NFT art market; three proposals were for NFT gaming apps;
three proposals were for NFT\'s for event ticketing; and two proposals
were for NFT trading cards. Of the groupings with indirect similarities
- where proposals shared a similar theme but not necessarily the same
idea - three proposals suggested NFT\'s as a business revenue stream
(for decentralized cinema funding, a children\'s education program and
an e-book marketplace); two proposals were for lottery-based
initiatives; two proposals were for general NFT marketplaces (including
one for general creative specializations); two proposals were for
porting NFT protocols from other blockchains; and one proposal generally
addressed issues related to game DApp development.

**MARKET COMPETITORS**

Seventeen existing NFT platforms were identified by the community within
the 27 proposals, including Cryptokitties and Superrare (both referenced
two times), Shimeji, Decentraland, My Crypto Heroes, Somnium Space, Gods
Unchained, CryptoVoxel, Blockchain Cuties, CryptoSpaceCommander,
Rarible, Known Origin, OpenSea, Mintible, MakersPlace, CryptoArt and
CryptoBrewMaster. An online search found 133 other NFT platforms whose
offerings generally ranged from collectibles in the form of digital art,
characters and game assets. From NonFungible.com\'s platform listing,
45.8% (56 of the 125 NFT platforms listed on the website) had made
trades within the last week, while 18.4% (23 of the 125 platforms
listed) had an all-time sales volume over \$1M. The top three,
Decentraland, Cryptokitties and Cryptopunks held a combined all-time
volume of \$88.55M (almost equal to the all-time volume of the other 122
platforms combined; a point also referenced within \@pavpowell\'s
proposal). Our main market competitors are:

-   Rarible (NFT-DAO)

-   Mintable (NFT-DAO)

-   Flamingo (NFT-DAO)

-   WAX (NFT Market)

-   OpenSea (NFT Market)

-   Nifty Gateway (NFT Market)

-   Foundation (NFT Auction House)

-   ERGO (NFT Auction House)

-   Aragon (DAO Market)

**MARKET OPPORTUNITY**

[Market Validation]{.ul}

Our goal is to mobilize the Project Catalyst community to stimulate NFT
development.

However, we don\'t think of this community as a market, but as peers.
This talent pool of innovators, developers, entrepreneurs and early
adopters mark one of the fastest growing DAO communities in the
blockchain space. According to a Crypto News Flash article, Cardano\'s
\'decentralized funding platform currently has more registered voters
than all of Ethereum\'s top 100 DAO\'s combined\' ^\[[5](#Sources)\]^.
In a recent Catalyst Town Hall (January 27 2021) it was identified that
there were 5614 members registered with Project Catalyst, a 10% increase
from the week before, including 808 members registered as community
advisers.

We aim to reinvest in this rapidly growing community, starting with
proposers of NFT related projects.

Cardano\'s Project Catalyst Fund3 saw 42 proposals (22.34% of total
fund-seeking proposals) interested in a diverse range of NFT use cases.
These proposals included 55 team-members in total. As of writing, there
were also 774 total kudos given to these proposals, as per IdeaScale\'s
community engagement metric. This represents a broader community of
supporters that may or may not be engaging specifically with the NFT
elements of each proposal.

This project will seek to approach and invite all of the 55 NFT
proposers to contribute to an NFT-DAO, as well as making wider
invitations to the roughly 774 supporters of those projects, and the
broader Catalyst and Cardano communities as a whole. By way of
deliverable, this project aims for 30% engagement at the lower bound and
50% engagement at the upper bound. \[UPDATE FROM THEN TO NOW: 111 PROPS
IN 1 MONTH (INCL. ALL PROPOSERS + KUDOS GIVEN)

From a spot analysis (dated March 7 2021) of 100 Project Catalyst
proposals that were sorted according to an \#NFT search
\[[6](#Sources)\], 74 proposals were identified as having NFT's as a
direct component of their project while 23 of these proposals had no
discussion of NFT's and 3 proposals were duplications of existing ones.
From these 74 NFT proposals, it was identified that members of 16
proposals had joined the NFT-DAO Discord server and 1 proposer had
joined from a non-NFT related proposal. In total, 19 proposers joined
the DAO from Project Catalyst. Four proposals came from Fund 3 while 13
proposals came from Fund 4. One proposing Fund 3 team (of four members)
have also agreed to collaborate with the DAO, but not as members of it.
**Therefore, the DAO is currently at 70% of its original goal to engage
participation with 24 proposers** (half of the 42 from Fund 3).

We will look at engaging these peer groups to build a strategic
alignment around NFT development on the blockchain, for the purposes of
delivering NFT initiatives to the established Cardano and Crypto
communities, and the new crypto and DeFi adopters. This project will be
pitched to anyone who wants to build NFTs on Cardano, with the purpose
of increasing development and new users to the blockchain.

[Market Size]{.ul}

According to NonFungible.com, the all-time NFT market cap (since June
2017), involves 5,227,502 NFT sales with a volume of US\$173,885,185.60.
The leading NFT sales came through ETH, MANA & WETH with an average
price of \$33.15. From the year beginning Feb 2020 and ending Feb 2021,
the number of daily trades has diminished from 3108 to 1820 (-58.56%),
however the value of the trades has increased: from a daily volume of
US\$113,980.23 (US\$36.67 per trade) to US\$1,374,030.61 (US\$757.46 per
trade) \[CITE\]

This represents a **1105.5% increase** in NFT market valuation for the
previous year.

According to data from cryptoart.io, the NFT art-space as a whole has
seen over \$382 million in total sales volume since April 2018 with the
majority of growth occurring in 2021. These sales involved 139,343
artwork sales at an average of 2,795 per sale. In February 2021,
\$98.48M worth of crypto-art was sold (or 25.78% of total all-time
sales) where \$75.26M (76.42%) of these sales were made on Nifty
Gateway. In March 2021, \$131.48M worth of crypto-art was sold (or
34.42% of total all-time sales) where \$93.1M (70.8%) of these sales
were made on Nifty Gateway \[[2](#Sources)\]. Two staggering figures
that arise from this are that **in February and March 2021, crypto-art
sales have exceeded all crypto-art sales to date.** Secondly, since
March 2020 (when total crypto-art sales were at \$350,360), **there has
been a 37,427% increase in crypto-art sales.** (These figures do not
include the many NFT use-cases outside of crypto art, including non-art
collectibles).

[Target Market]{.ul}

Our target market comprises developers, creatives, entrepreneurs,
intellectuals, and Cardanians who want to create NFT marketplaces, NFT
businesses and attractants to the new capabilities of Cardano that allow
anyone to tokenize digital, intellectual, and real-world assets.

[Marketing Fundamentals]{.ul}

What is Needed for Success?

-   **Market**: robust transactional spaces;

-   **User**: mass-scale adoption;

-   **Product**: outcome driven utility.

*Markets *do not occur without Users. *Users* do not arrive unless there
is something to use, a *Product *(or service). Many of the ideas
proposed offer these components and collaborating can amalgamate the
best of these. Example: A scientific-method, first-principles approach
is what brought CryptoKitties to market, the most successful NFT to
date. Axiom Zen is a Canadian Venture Studio whose research and
processes launched DapperLabs, who brought the CryptoKitties to market.
They are now building FLOW, a \$6M market cap blockchain. We have
Cardano, a \$32B market cap blockchain as our tech base. We have a large
community of project managers, developers, marketers and researchers who
can collectively match any organization in the world. We need to work
together. \[LINK\]

[Recommendations from the Project Catalyst Fund3 Proposals Survey]{.ul}

From this initial survey of NFT proposals within Project Catalyst, and
NFT platforms currently on the market, it is proposed that:

-   Consideration be given by the Catalyst community to support a
    strategic alignment regarding NFT initiatives in a way that will
    maximize and streamline the collective interests and efforts of the
    community in this domain;

-   As it is forecast that NFT proposals will only proliferate over
    time, it is proposed that an NFT steering group (a community within
    the community) composed of those with an interest in NFT dev.,
    including recent proposers, may provide a more effective strategy
    for guiding and fast-tracking Cardano\'s NFT development. This is in
    contrast with a scatter-gun or competitive approach, which runs the
    risk of wasted effort, resources and decreased community morale for
    unsuccessful proposers;

-   It is proposed that the NFT steering group be fluid and open to the
    community for wider consultation, and act as a resource to NFT
    proposers or initiatives wishing to remain autonomous;

-   It is proposed that the NFT steering group hold a secondary function
    of monitoring and evaluating its processes for the purposes of
    knowledge sharing with prospective steering groups that seek to
    align around other strategic topic areas. It is not intended that
    such steering groups replace Community Choice campaigns, but that
    they serve to support the ongoing implementation of past or
    prospective campaigns.

-   NOTE: In the course of Project Catalyst Fund3, over 10 NFT-DAO
    proposers have joined NFT-DAO. At that same time, 99 more
    NFT-related proposals have been added since the launch of
    Fund4[]{#OurStructure .anchor}.

**Our Structure**

[]{#SocialConsensus .anchor}**SOCIAL CONSENSUS: COLLABORATIVE CULTURE &
SHARED GOVERNANCE**

This section will outline the conceptual underpinnings of the NFT-DAO's
organizational model and governance structure, and then discuss how a
tokenization strategy can be employed to support community governance,
incentivised collaboration and stimulate the growth of Cardano's NFT
economy.

**DECENTRALISED AUTONOMOUS ORGANISATIONS (DAO)**

Ethereum blockchain co-founder Vitalik Buterin coined the term
Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) in a 2014 blog-post \[CITE\]
that discussed decentralised organisations. In particular he describes a
spectrum of organisational structures that vary in their degrees of
machine and human-driven interactions, and that are also defined by
whether or not that organisation supplies its own internal capital, such
as native tokens.

![](media/image4.jpg){width="5.091666666666667in"
height="2.4632884951881016in"}

Figure: DO, DAO, DA & DC matrix (Buterin, 2014)

In Buterin's definition, an ideal DAO is 'an entity that lives on the
internet and exists autonomously, but also heavily relies on hiring
individuals to perform certain tasks that the automaton itself cannot
do.' He contrasts this with a Decentralised Organisation (DO), which
replaces the hierarchical organisational model and instead 'involves a
set of humans interacting with each other according to a protocol
specified in code, and enforced on the blockchain.' For Buterin, the
difference between the two is that 'in a DO the humans are the ones
making the decisions, and a DAO is something that, in some fashion,
makes decisions for itself.' This definition points more toward machine
consensus (or governance) so that the human participants are there to
support the non-machine implementation of the code. Machine first, human
second.

As addressed by Buterin himself, the terms are complicated and unclear.
In today's blockchain environment, DAO's and DO's appear to be somewhat
synonymous, and range in varying degrees of interpretation and
human-machine interaction. The term DAO has tended to become an umbrella
concept in the crypto-space to describe any kind of decentralised
organisation including co-operatives, heterarchies, P2P networks,
holarchies, sociocracies, collectives, collaborations or those named by
Buterin. Either way, it is clear that there is a growing demand for
alternatives to hierarchies, monopolies or oligarchies that concentrate
power amongst the few.

**HOLONIC MODELS**

Ulieru et al. describe holon structures in their paper *The Holonic
Enterprise as a Collaborative Information Ecosystem* (2001) as first
being introduced by Arthur Koestler in his book *The Ghost in The
Machine* (1967). They describe holon's as 'an amalgamation of the Latin
word "holos" meaning whole, and the suffix "on" which implies particle
or part. So, holon = whole & part. The term comes from a recognition
that any entity in a natural or organizational system is simultaneously
a whole entity comprised of sub-entities, and a sub-entity portion of
one or more super-entities.\' (p. 2). They further describe '\[o\]ne
main characteristic of a holon is its multiple granularity manifested
through replication into self-similar structures at multi-resolution
levels. Such a heterarchical decomposition turns out into a nested
hierarchy of fractal entities---named a holarchy\' (p. 1). The authors
go on to propose the holonic enterprise as a new business model or 'a
holarchy of collaborative enterprises, where the enterprise is regarded
as a holon' (p. 1). This enterprise 'enables participants in the global
market to enter strategic partnerships via the web-enabled
cyber-playground by harmoniously managing the workflow throughout the
nested holarchy of the collaborative information ecosystem\' (p. 12).

Experience within the NFT-DAO's founding team has included teaching
holonic architectures for many years, and adding to the academic
literature on heterarchical approaches in the field of peer-driven (P2P)
production. Since holonic enterprises are complimentary with DAO's in
the blockchain space, the NFT-DAO has opted to bridge the two approaches
to support a scalable machine-assisted collaborative economy.

**NFT'S AND THE DAO: A HOLONIC APPROACH**

Nonfungible.com describes \'Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) \[as\] unique,
digital items with blockchain-managed ownership. Examples of NFT
use-case includes collectables, game items, digital art, event tickets,
domain names, and ownership records for tangible assets' \[CITE\]. 2020
saw a **1105.5% increase** in NFT market valuation \[CITE\]. At a time
with piqued interest in NFT's throughout the crypto community; when
Project Catalyst is now the world's largest decentralised community fund
(Project Catalyst Townhall, March 3 2021) and when Cardano is on the
verge of supporting both native token and NFT minting, there is an
exciting opportunity to support a holistic approach to NFT
implementation across all assets and industries: from collectibles to
contracts to real estate.

A larger question then arises: in what ways could NFT's be integrated
with the DAO itself?

There is a possibility to conceptually bridge NFT\'s (on the
micro-layer) and DAO\'s (on the macro-layer), through holonic modelling.
Holons may have fixed or variable functions, like NFT\'s, which can be
written into smart contracts and triggered. This is based on principles
of Machine Consensus. As outline by Buterin (2014), DAO\'s were
originally founded on machine consensus, so that contracts could be
executed trustlessly. However, some DAO\'s (like our own) require trust
since we are composed of a series of working-group holons involved in
collaborative decision-making (a DO, in Buterin's sense). Social
Consensus requires some degree of trust. It may be desirable to design a
holonic infrastructure to contain the same fixed variables at the
micro-scale (machine consensus) and macro scale (social consensus), so
that (IF) a social consensus is reached (THEN) a smart contract is
triggered (as per a DO). It naturally follows that (IF) a machine
consensus is reached (THEN) a social contract is triggered (as per a
DAO). Both are possibilities. You would of course need a consensus
mechanism to capture, collate and trigger the smart and social
contracts.

A master contract might be written and applied to all transactions and
holons within the network, with fixed and/or variable functions (ie,
when the social consensus is made that *x*% of every transaction will go
to Holon-*y*. Since each holon could potentially have an infinite
variety of functions/consensus-splits, then these unique variations
could be attached to an NFT. The outcome may be a step toward a fully
integrated and holistic tokenization model founded on both machine and
social consensus.

Figure: DAO infograph (Voshmgir, 2019).

**COLLABORATION: A DISCUSSION (WITH RICH KOPCHO)**

*"We have a long-term view of the viability this asset can become for
the Cardano community\
and are wholly committed to seeing it to fruition"*

As the core team of founders started to work together, several great
ideas emerged. We have a lot of background in social systems, P2P and
holonic architectures. It was natural to start thinking about how we are
organized. The Decentralized Autonomous Organizational (DAO) structures,
while not perfect, were presenting several opportunities. Catalyst
itself is a DAO. Our collab is meant to gather all the NFT proposals
together and save community resources by building the common elements
they will all need. Instead of funding every NFT proposal to create the
same thing over and over, we felt we could consolidate the efforts to
everyone's benefit. Modelling holonic nested heterarchies, we are
creating a focused NFT DAO within the Catalyst DAO. Our hope is the
community will see the benefit of building this kind of architecture to
focus Cardano NFT efforts and gain explicit experience and speed to
market at scale.

*"We are growing an NFT-DAO from the ground up, learning and training
all who join us in the process."*

A DAO is simply a means of organizing the work (the O in DAO). It's an
organizational model. It provides guidance for who does what, when, how
and why through well-established communications and a set of rules or
functions. Thus, our very first task was defining the work to be done
and assigning owners. This is not the first our team has experienced
implementing this kind of structure. I personally trained thousands of
individuals over ten years in holonic systems deployments worldwide.
Troy is writing his PhD. thesis on a similar P2P topic. DAOs have their
roots in holonics. By modelling these processes, we will in time become
a well-oiled DAO focused on NFTs.

*"We will be learning from Catalyst and hopefully Catalyst will be
learning from our experiences as well."*

On the social layer, we aim to work together as a community to build the
frameworks, scaffolds, schemas, patterns and integrations required for a
robust NFT offering. Once the tech stack is launched, we will charge an
appropriate licensing fee (as justified by community service) to fund
the DAO treasury and to maintain and enhance the technology and sustain
the DAO ecology. We will build the canon or rules of engagement as we
accomplish our core goal of creating the BOXCAR.

**DAO GOVERNANCE**

The governance and tokenization model for the NFT-DAO is emergent, and
includes iterations as expressed by member input, team-building,
prototyping, testing and evaluation. A series of group consultations
have been held using an online townhall format, as well as online
discussions between DAO members concerning issues pertinent to community
growth and engagement. Issues surrounding the organisational and
economic structure of the DAO will be discussed here.

[VOTING]{.ul} In the interim

Voting participation and quorums

Equitable distribution of governance tokens and recognition of
contributions

Recognition as a DAO-LLC

Charter: definition of a member

Relationship between members, teams and a DAO

What is our phase within the DAO (ie, moving from a partially
centralised to fully decentralised participation)

What is 'member' status (or levels of voting power)

List of definitions

[Holonic Structure]{.ul} - The NFT-DAO builds Holon's as thematic
organisational structures or working-groups, supported by project leads;

[NFT-DAO Membership]{.ul} - The NFT-DAO is open for all members to join

[NFT-DAO Invitations]{.ul} - Invites are currently targeted toward
Project Catalyst NFT-proposers, NFT-DAO project supporters; and
developers, creatives and specialists with a desire to build NFT markets
on Cardano;

[Current Onboarding]{.ul} - The onboarding process for new members is
currently provided through Discord invitation links available via the
NFT-DAO proposal pages on Project Catalyst (IdeaScale), the NFT-DAO
webpage and via member invitations.

[Current Onboarding (Flow)]{.ul} - New DAO members are directed to the
Discord \#welcome page which includes links to an Airtable to support
KYC onboarding, and the \#intro channel to introduce themselves and
learn about who else is in the community and their skill-sets, for the
purposes of identifying interest areas, collaborative opportunities and
potential holon memberships (team building).

[Potential Onboarding]{.ul} -- May include a mandatory
sign-up/registration that instantly qualifies as a KYC for the BOXCAR
(if they opt into the DAO). A profile/account can be set-up. For voting
purposes, members can only register one wallet to vote at a time, and
only registered (Tier 4) members can vote on special polls while anyone
can vote on general polls.

[Incentivization Strategy]{.ul} -- It is proposed that five
incentivization metrics be tokenized within the network: 1) Sweat Equity
(for casual pro bono work contributed within the community); 2) Social
Equity (through a trust score metric shared between community members);
3) incentivization's for BOXCAR trailblazers whose markets are
stimulating growth within the community; 4) incentives for governance
voting contributions; and 5) dividend payments in the form of one-off or
recurring token drops. (There is also be a sixth metric in the form of
Paid Equity for rateable hours completed).

[Tiered Engagement Program (Holon Levels)]{.ul} - To support the
incentivization of meaningful engagement in the community, it is
envisioned that the NFT-DAO will employ a tiered engagement program that
will incentivise levels of engagement by members. This tier structure
will build upon the DAO's broader tokenization model and incentivisation
strategy as follows:

[Level 1 Holon (Tier 1 Engagement)]{.ul} -- Includes entry into the
NFT-DAO and unlocks access to community holons, and general proposals
and voting. Like the general retail market, Level 1 Holons can purchase
NFT-DAO tokens (NFD/NFD1) as an equity investment, but higher levels of
engagement will be required to unlock various utilities of the token.
Sub-tiers will include the amounts of Investment Equity held;

> [Level 2 Holon (Tier 2 Engagement)]{.ul} -- includes completion of a
> light KYC form (AirTable) to receive a Social Equity token (this may
> need to be verified by a minimum number of community members). Unlocks
> Social Equity token utility (NFD2) which can be rewarded by community
> members for appreciation of community contributions. Sub-tiers will
> include the amounts of Social Equity accrued over time;

[Level 3 Holon (Tier 3 Engagement)]{.ul} -- includes completing a
community task or bounty to an agreed upon standard of satisfaction.
Unlocks Sweat Equity token utility (NFD3) which can be received for
pro-bono task completion within the community. Sub-tiers will include
the amounts of Sweat Equity accrued over time;

> [Level 4 Holon (Tier 4 Engagement)]{.ul} -- includes completing Levels
> 1-3 to unlock proposal, feedback and special voting access (to propose
> and vote on special proposals). Unlocks Special Voter token utility
> (NFD4). Voting will be weighted by the volume and ratio of Investment
> Equity (NFD/NFD1), Social Equity (NFD2) and Sweat Equity (NFD3) that a
> holon has. Sub-tiers will include the amounts of Voting power accrued
> over time (based on special proposal, feedback and voting engagement);

[Level 5 Holon (Tier 5 Engagement)]{.ul} -- includes application and
successful selection into a dedicated team role that unlocks Paid Equity
(NFD5) through PTE, FTE or contractual employment. Level 5 Holons also
receive increased Voting power and are able to submit formal (paid)
bounties/jobs on the platform. Sub-tiers will include breadth of
leadership positions or roles of responsibility within and across
holons.

[Equity Weightings]{.ul} (draft) -- it is proposed that equity
weightings be patterned directly after the NFT-DAO token distribution
model in a self-replicating, holonic manner. In the above chart,
weightings are distributed so that Investor Equity (Level 1) holds a 50%
voter-weighting; Social Equity (Level 2) holds 15%, Sweat Equity (Level
3) holds 15%, Voter Equity (Level 4) holds 15% and Paid Equity (Level 5)
holds 5%. This means that for every vote, a Level 1 holds a maximum of
50% weight, a Level 2 65% (max), a Level 3 80% (max), and Level 4 95%
(max) and a Level 5 100%. A secondary weighting depends on the amount of
equity a member has accrued.

[Tiered Engagement Pathways]{.ul} -- it is also of note that members
will not necessarily move up tiers in a linear manner. Some may accrue
sweat equity before social equity, some may choose against a KYC and
forego social equity altogether, while others may be contracted to
receive Paid Equity without being a member of the DAO. In all these
cases, a members Tier Level will still be determined by the number of
tiers they have engaged with -- not the order of engagement.

Examples: A contractor receiving paid equity without being a member of
the DAO will have a 0% equity weighting; a contractor receiving *only*
paid equity (and nothing else) but who has chosen to join the DAO (as a
Level 1), will be a Level 2 Holon with a 55% Equity Weighting (Level 1 &
5 combined). A member who declines a KYC (Level 2) can accrue Sweat
Equity with a 65% Equity Weighting (Level 1 & 3 combined). They can vote
on general proposals/polls but they will be unable to vote on special
proposals (Level 4: requires Level 2). A member who joins at the same
time and accepts a KYC (Level 2) will then be able to access Social
Equity tokens and have the same voter weighting of 65% (Level 1 & 2
combined). However, once they engage in Sweat Equity (Level 3) *and meet
an adequate target*, they will qualify for Voter Equity (Level 4)
beginning at 80% (minimum) to 95% (maximum), and be able to engage in
special proposals and voting.

[Tiered Engagement Gamification]{.ul} - It is also proposed that the
tiered engagement process be gamified so that members receive unique and
rare digital collectibles as they progress through the Engagement
Pathway. These collectibles may range from unique Level 1-5 Holon
Characters, or in-game assets such as property, clothes, pets, land,
vehicles, treasures and possessions that can be traded amongst members.
It may also be envisioned that a platform Dapp be created that measures
Equity accrual and milestones; stores assets in a unique wallet; enables
NFT marketplace formation and trading; and provides access to proposals,
voting mechanisms, project tools, holon chats -- and all presented
In-Game.

[PROPOSALS]{.ul}

**MACHINE CONSENSUS: TOKENIZED INNOVATION**

**TECHNICAL DETAILS**

NFT-DAO EASY ON-BOARDING (EZ-ON): INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT

As part of the Project Catalyst Fund4 strategy, the preliminary
technical projects NFT-DAO will focus on will be the building and launch
of an NFT Marketplace infrastructure and MVP in the form of a minting
platform. The problem the infrastructure seeks to address is the
difficulty and lack of tools developers face when seeking to build
DApps, composable components and interoperability for NFT use-cases. The
NFT-DAO is partnering with **IOG Professional Services** and **MuKn.io**
(<https://MuKn.io>) to make building NFT infrastructure fast, easy to
write and auditable, to onboard the general public (the ocean) and the
Cardano community (the pond).

**MuKn** (pronounced Moon) are official partners with Cardano and IOHK
\[CITE\], and they specialise in cybersecurity, cryptography,
distributed systems, systems programming, economic modelling and
mechanism design. NFT-DAO will be supported by MuKn's Glow: a
'java-script for blockchain' used to make decentralised applications
which feature safety, user-friendliness and cross-chain portability
\[cite\]. Through Glow, MuKn have automated and abstracted a vast amount
of code and expertise. NFT-DAO will leverage this expertise to build the
right tools and ecosystem for the NFT developers we seek to support.

The NFT-DAO seeding phase (Catalyst Fund3) will build **the first NFT
marketplace framework** that all 120+ NFT-centric proposals to date can
use to purpose-build marketplaces on Cardano---natively, quickly and
easily. We intend to harden and extend the MVP capabilities while we
work on **improving the developer eco-system** and experience on
Cardano. We aim to do this by:

-   Creating a space for new developers to connect with more NFT/Cardano
    developers inside the DAO;

-   Providing a collaborative ecology where open-source developer
    contributions will support newcomer onboarding;

-   Providing pathways into one of NFT-DAO\'s agile teams.

NFT-DAO is leading the charge already, making Cardano the de facto place
for creators, entrepreneurs and developers to collaborate together on
NFT business models. We aim to make our collaborative culture:

-   Easy for creators with no blockchain experience;

-   Quick and safe for ETH developers to onboard;

-   Entrepreneurs can build marketplaces fast and simply.

The vision of NFT-DAO EZ-ON: Infrastructure Development is to support
the fastest transition of NFT dominance from Ethereum to Cardano. With
high gas fees driven by an energy-intensive Proof of Work consensus
model, EZ-ON seeks to support Cardano NFT adoption by current Ethereum
NFT buyers, sellers and marketplaces that are seeking lower transaction
costs under a more ecologically sustainable Proof of Stake model.

To do so, NFT-DAO aims to build the developer ecosystem tools, libraries
and contracts necessary to handle 80% of the most common use cases that
are needed for this transition, as well as employing the **ERC20 and
ERC721 token converters** in the interim. Additionally, we intend to
provide tools for Java developers who represent 40.2% of programmers
(whereas Haskell represent 2.1%). Providing easy on-boarding (EZ-on) for
these Ocean programmers is a longer-term goal that will extend into
Fund-5.

[Partnering for Success: Joining the Experts]{.ul} **[\
]{.ul}**\
We will partner our lead developers with the experts at MuKn.io and the
IOG Professional Services engineers to fast-track a path to success.
Finley McIllwaine is our team\'s expert on all things Plutus and will
engage specifically with Plutus code.

**MULTI-CURRENCY LEDGER**

NFTs are our primary focus and purpose. The introduction of a
multi-currency ledger model into Cardano allows the network to support
additional cryptocurrencies, similar to ERC20 tokens, but **cheaply,
more securely, and without the need for a complex scripting
system** thanks to native support in the settlement layer. Not only are
users able to create their own fungible tokens on the Cardano network,
but a multi-currency ledger also allows for tokenization with
the **creation of non-fungible tokens,** plus easier integration with
smart contracts involving multiple cryptocurrencies.

**SMART CONTRACTS**

Supporting our focus on non-fungible tokens with the integration of
smart contracts, the Goguen era represents a big step forward in
capability for the Cardano network. Where the Shelley era decentralizes
the core of the system, Goguen will add the ability to
build **decentralized applications (DApps)** on Cardano\'s solid
foundation of peer-reviewed research and high-assurance development.

The work for Goguen has been under way in parallel with Shelley, and
when complete will **allow users from technical and non-technical
backgrounds** to create and execute functional smart contracts on the
Cardano network. One of the goals for the Goguen era has been the
creation of Plutus, a purpose-built smart contract development language
and execution platform using the functional programming language
Haskell. Plutus is already available for testing and brings the benefits
of functional programming to smart contract creation. It also allows one
code base to support both on and off-chain components, improving the
coherency and usability of the development experience compared with
existing smart contract implementations.

The Goguen era also promotes **Cardano's accessiblility to wider
audiences via Marlowe,** allowing financial and business experts
with **no previous technical knowledge to create smart
contracts.** Marlowe is a high-level, domain-specific language (DSL) for
financial contracts which is built on Plutus. Marlowe comes with the
Marlowe Playground, an easy-to-use application-building platform
that **non-programmers** can use to build financial smart contracts.
Together, Marlowe and the Marlowe Playground simplify the process of
creating smart contracts for financial applications, allowing subject
matter experts to directly contribute **without requiring deep
programming skills.** The combination of Plutus and Marlowe will enable
a new class of enterprise-level **smart contracts with verified
functionality**, capable of underpinning large-scale implementations in
the real world.

As well as adding functionality in the form of smart contracts, Goguen
will also see improvements to the core Cardano offering. Most
significantly, the addition of a multi-currency ledger will extend the
usefulness of Cardano even further, enabling users to **create new
natively-supported tokens**. This will allow the creation of fungible
and **non-fungible tokens**, supporting the creation of new
cryptocurrencies on Cardano as well as the **tokenization of many types
of digital and physical assets**. Another benefit will be easier
integration of smart contracts and DApps involving multiple
cryptocurrencies.

The Goguen era represents a step change in Cardano, opening the way for
the development of enterprise-level, mission-critical, decentralized
smart contract applications with even more exciting things to come
during the Basho and Voltaire eras.

**FINANCIAL STRATEGY**

**FUNDING PHASES**

[Development & Operations Funding (Short-to-Midterm) \|
US\$250,000-\$1,000,000]{.ul}

The NFT-DAO will seek development and operations funding through Project
Catalyst across project phases, including the DAO and BOXCAR development
and launch at a total estimated cost of US\$250,000.

In the short-term, one of the principal funding avenues sought for the
NFT-DAO and NFT BOXCAR for development and operations funding is Project
Catalyst. The largest decentralised fund in the world \[CITE\], Project
Catalyst was launched by Cardano in September 2020 \[CITE: IOHK or
Cardano Foundation?\] on the IdeaScale platform as a means to enable the
Cardano community to forward proposals within three preliminary
categories: Dapp Creation, Developer Ecosystems and Community Choice, to
support social and economic growth and sustainability on the Cardano
blockchain. As of writing, the community-driven fund now allocates 1.5
million ADA every six weeks to successful proposals across \[NUMBER\]
categories. The community not only forward the proposals, but they
provide feedback to refine the proposals, they act as community advisors
who rate the proposals, and they vote on which projects to deploy funds
to as well as choosing which categories the fund will focus on in future
rounds. By way of incentivisation, community advisers and voters receive
nominal token rewards in ADA for their contributions. Voters are also
required to hold a minimum of 3000 ADA in their wallets during a voting
snapshot prior to voting rounds opening (this has been recently been
reduced from 8000 ADA - since the market price of the token had
increased - to enable higher voter turn-outs). Fund3 currently has
10,000 unique wallet addresses available for voting with a similar
proportion of community members. Although the fund is administered by
IOHK via project and product managers, the project is becoming
progressively decentralised, in the same way that the Cardano project is
as well.

The NFT-DAO is comprised of a group of Entrepreneur's, Developers,
Artists, Specialists and Enthusiasts who believe in Cardano and Project
Catalyst, and the proposal is embedded in this community. It is
therefore seen as beneficial and appropriate to seek funds within this
forum, and to do so through a unified and consolidated approach with
willing members of this community, gathering around NFT development.

In the mid-term, the NFT-DAO will also explore other funding sources
that support the development of Cardano, blockchain initiatives, NFT and
DAO development, and crypto entrepreneurship.

[Growth & Expansion Funding (Mid-to-Longterm) \| US\$1,000,000-5,000,000
pa.]{.ul}

The NFT-DAO will seek to be fully self-sustaining and self-organising
through the development and implementation of a community tokenization
model of governance, incentivization and fee allocation.

In the mid-to-longterm, the NFT-DAO will seek a self-sustaining model of
growth and expansion funding through the provision of services to
community members. These services will include access to the developer,
marketing, creative, legal, financial, communications, strategy,
networking and specialist pools and products being delivered by the
community. These products will also relate to the NFT marketplaces and
businesses built upon the BOXCAR, and to external partnerships and
collaborations outside of the community. It is envisioned that fees on
all transactions, be they NFD's (NFT-DAO native tokens) or NFT's
(non-fungible tokens) be taxed as follows:

> [NFT-DAO Global Fee]{.ul}: **\
> A fixed rate of 1% (per transaction) + a variable rate of x% (per
> asset category)**
>
> This fee is factored so that x% is voted on by the community. Asset
> categories relate to Internal (BOXCAR-minted) or External (off-DAO) NT
> or NFT asset classes such as: 1) Collectables; 2) In-Game Assets; 3)
> Digital Art; 4) Event Tickets; 5) Domain Names; 6) Ownership records
> for tangible assets; 7) Digital real estate; 8) Tokenized physical
> real estate; 9) Intellectual property; 10) Warranties; 11) Insurance;
> 12) Badges; 13) Certifications; and any form of tokenizable digital or
> physical asset.

These fees will be used to support the ongoing sustainability of the
NFT-DAO including infrastructure and product development and testing,
market outreach, media content, equity investment, ongoing
community-building and engagement, research and new market exploration.
In the 2--3-year mark, we estimate the revenue generated from the DAO to
be in the vicinity of \$1 million per annum less \$250,000 operational
costs. We expect this revenue to increase toward \$5 million per annum
beyond the 5-year horizon, not adjusting for market volatility and token
price fluctuations.

**NATIVE TOKENS (NT)**

[Native NFT_DAO Token (NFD)]{.ul} -- The NFT-DAO is developing its own
native token: **the NFD token** (working title: pronounced 'Niff-D").

[Token Circulation]{.ul} -- To enable a wide range of community
engagement and utility over time, balanced with a desire to increase the
tokens value through the stimulation of demand, the NFD token will be
capped at **\$210,000,000 NFD.**

[Fractional Denominations]{.ul} -- Fractional denominations akin to ADA
lovelaces, ETH gwei and BTC satoshi's will be called **Holons** or
**Dominoes** (working title), named after the holonic structure of the
DAO.

NFD tokens can be used for:

1.  [Governance]{.ul} - Governance by granting weighted voting power in
    proportion to NFD held. This utility will appeal to token holders
    building equity within the NFT-DAO and BOXCAR platform, with voting
    rights to change standards, support proposals, funding deployment or
    dividend distribution;

2.  [Incentives]{.ul} -- Used as payment for Paid, Social or Sweat
    Equity or rewards though Voting Contributions and Dividends for
    tokens staked, minted or traded within the network;

3.  [Investment]{.ul} -- Used as an investment asset for crypto users,
    consumers and traders within NFT-DAO.

**NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS (NFT)**

[Native Non-Fungible Tokens]{.ul} (NFB's) - NFT's minted on the NFT
BOXCAR are nicknamed: **NFB's** (working title) to differentiate them
from Off-DAO NFT's.

**NFT-DAO TOKEN DISTRIBUTION MODEL**

The NFT-DAO will look at a token distribution model that covers five key
domains. These are:

1.  Operational Fund;

2.  Incentive Fund;

3.  Investment Fund;

4.  Community Discretionary Fund;

5.  Community Token Offering.

[The Operational Fund]{.ul} -- 15% of total token circulation will be
allocated to developing collaboration culture by funding operational
holons, including Development, Marketing and Community. Team members and
teams (in-house and out-sourced) within these holons will receive Paid
Equity in the form of NFD tokens per rateable hours, as agreed by Holon
consensus.

[The Incentive Fund]{.ul} -- 15% of total token circulation will be
allocated to incentivizing innovation and participation within the DAO
network. Incentivization metrics will include Sweat Equity (for casual
pro bono work contributed within the community); Social Equity (through
a trust score metric shared between community members);
incentivization's for BOXCAR trailblazers whose markets are stimulating
growth within the community; incentives for governance voting
contributions; and dividend payments in the form of one-off or recurring
token drops.

[The Investment Fund]{.ul} -- 15% of total token circulation will be
allocated to shared governance by building a community-driven investment
fund. The fund will generate revenue from an NFT-DAO Global transaction
fee (set at a fixed-rate of 1% plus a variable-voteable rate of x%);
Marketplace Liquidity Mining -- Fees and earning of NFD tokens by
minting, selling, and buying NFTs; Stake pools; DeFi Offerings --
including NFT liquidity pools and revenue rights granting NFTs; and
Equity Investments in Internal and External ventures. Investment and the
deployment of dividends from the Investment Fund can be voted for by the
community through a bounties and proposals process, as patterned after
Project Catalyst (for instance: after an epoch, 50% of the Global Fee
may be applied to the Operational Fund while 50% may be deployed to
token holders through an NFT drop).

[Community Discretionary Fund]{.ul} -- 5% of total token circulation
will be allocated to a Community Discretionary Fund. This fund may act
as a surplus fund to be accessed under special conditions, as agreed by
community consensus. Deployment of tokens from the Discretionary Fund
can be voted for by the community through a bounties and proposals
process, as patterned after Project Catalyst. The fund may support
future network development, stimulate further growth in high yield
areas, fund undercapitalised projects or be gifted as a charity to
people in need.

[Community Token Offering]{.ul} -- 50% of total token circulation will
be allocated as a Community Token Offering once the NFD token is
launched. This may be offered as a full ITO in conjunction with the
launch of the NFT BOXCAR platform. It may also be a staged approach with
tokens released at 5-10% instalments (split equally between the retail
market and NFT-DAO membership). These staged or staggered token
offerings can align with the funding requirements of the DAO's
developmental roadmap. It is the desire of the DAO to enable
transferability between NFD's, BOXCAR-minted NFT's (NFB's), Off-DAO
NFT's and ADA.

**EARNING REWARDS**

As part of the NFT-DAO Tokenization model, rewards can be paid to
community contributors in a number of ways. Equity contributions can be
made as follows:

-   Sweat Equity (pro bono contributions);

-   Social Equity (community trust rewards);

-   Paid Equity (rateable hours delivered).

[Sweat Equity]{.ul} -- Pro bono contributions within the community
ranging from successful branding or logo designs, task and bounty
completion, referrals and recruitment, market research assignments,
business documentation, social media sharing, content production,
resource procurement, networking milestones, coding, database and
library management, administration, community management -- and much
more -- can be captured within the DAO onboarding and community
management process. Sweat Equity can then be distributed to contributors
in the form of NFD tokens based on a consensus-based market valuation of
the work done. Sweat Equity is a contribution option for participants
not employed by the DAO or members operating in a casual or
non-professional capacity, to tokenise their efforts and contributions.
This process will also seek to stimulate community participation and
leverage the community's skills in task completion. Market valuations
may also rank certain tasks by size, as proposed by the community, and
contributors may be able to claim a bounty for their completed task,
which must then be signed of by a quorum of community members.

[Social Equity]{.ul} -- An additional value metric that accompanies
Sweat Equity is Social Equity. This is a P2P contribution where members
can offer other members micro-rewards (like BAT tips, IdeaScale kudos or
Reddit karma). These rewards are also paid out as NFD tokens at a
standard nominal rate, with the option to increase that rate depending
on the value the giver feels the receiver has offered them or the
community. Social Equity is a measure of social trust also, as Social
Equity can also be paid out by the treasury based on Know-Your-Customer
(KYC) information each member chooses to disclose with the community.
This metric can be measured once new members onboard into the DAO.
Social Equity can also create a gauge a metric, in combination with
Sweat Equity, to determine how much the community values the work the
member is providing (quality) rather then the rate of work only
(quantity). There is a possibility that alliances within the community
may decide to share Social Equity amongst themselves to increase their
trust score. However, a ratio can be implemented that identifies the
rates of trust swapping amongst individual accounts within the network,
which may implement a cap on trust scores that are marked as being
manipulative.

[Paid Equity]{.ul} -

[The Incentive Fund]{.ul} -- 15% of total token circulation will be
allocated to incentivizing innovation and participation within the DAO
network. Incentivization metrics will include Sweat Equity (for casual
pro bono work contributed within the community); Social Equity (through
a trust score metric shared between community members);
incentivization's for BOXCAR trailblazers whose markets are stimulating
growth within the community; incentives for governance voting
contributions; and dividend payments in the form of one-off or recurring
token drops.

15% of total token circulation will be allocated to developing
collaboration culture by funding operational holons, including
Development, Marketing and Community. Team members and teams (in-house
and out-sourced) within these holons will receive Paid Equity in the
form of NFD tokens per rateable hours, as agreed by Holon consensus.

Incentive Program (Equity Pool) 12% (Sweat Pro bono 7%, Social Trust 3%,
Voting Contributions 2%)\
Investment (Revenue Pool) 12% (subs/Memberships, Stake Pools,
Business/Equity Investments, Fees on all NFT transactions = 1% + x%, 20%
artists fee = 1% + x%, Marketplace Liquidity Mining, Defi
Offerings/Liquidity Pools)

Pro-rata

-   **Marketplace Liquidity Mining:** Earn NFTDAO governance token by
    minting, selling, and buying NFTs.

-   **Transaction Fees:** There will be a small predictable fee involved
    with the minting of each asset.

-   **DeFi offerings:** NFT liquidity pools. Revenue rights granting
    NFTs.

**PROTECTION**

Game theory -- protecting against centralisation by large players.
Protection against inflation or 0% fees? (fixed 1% + x% variable --
changed by voting?)

A\) Dividends from fees accrued on Boxcar (ie, weekly airdrops) 50% to
NFT DAO (with wallet snapshot/inspection pw?) and 50% distributed to
holders. This can incentivise fair voting of fees. B) 'Seller' fees
could be lower when holding a proportion in our token; c) NFT drops; d)
voting on bringing in various creators;

Assuming two types of holders: 1) storefront operators/NFT standard
proposers (large holders)\
2) Users (people buying token speculating on value would fall here as
well (small holders)

Resource: icodrops \[LINK\]

**Goal: Create a natural flow/cycle of token from user to storefront and
give a value for both parties.\
(is there a natural flow-cycle? What about external buyers/participants
who speculate off platform?)\
We see the BOXCAR storefronts making the most proposals to the DAO, so
we provide extra rewards to BOXCAR storefronts by offering a variable
fee rate based on % holding of token.**

**10k tokens = 1% reduced after seller fee\
50k tokens = 3% reduced after seller fee\
\
Note: can't be a flat rate. Should be % of sales to prevent storefront
holding all. If it was fixed, could distribute to multiple wallets under
same ownership. % of sales requires them to be all under the same
wallet, which allows for logarithmic dividends? (EXPLAIN)**

Question: what does a tokenised transaction look like within the Beta
MVP and Alpha product?

**A MICRO-ECONOMY**

[What does a holistic tokenization model look like?]{.ul}

After the Midterm deliverables are met, where NFD tokens have been
minted for sale and have been integrated into the ecology of the
NFT-DAO, a potential Longterm (5-10 year) phase may include the mass
deployment of native tokens (NFD) and BOXCAR-minted NFT tokens (NFB's)
into a holistic tokenization model. With the roll-out of a wide range of
business platforms via the NFT BOXCAR, it is envisioned that such use
cases as NFT contracts, collectibles, rewards, art, certifications, real
estate, digital assets, tickets, e-books, music, contributions, film
productions, or IP royalties to name a few, provide an opportunity to
automate tokenized micro-transactions across the entire supply-chain. It
is envisioned the NFT-DAO will be well-positioned to support a
micro-economy through the development of smart contract protocols that
trigger the immediate sale and purchase of NFD's and NFT's whenever
NFT-DAO related assets are transacted. A nominal fee will be deducted to
further stimulate NFT-DAO growth through development of initiatives and
incentivised token deployment back to the community. Contributors to NFT
assets and related services may also receive automated
micro-transactions in proportion to the percentage splits agreed upon
when the smart contract was written.

It is further envisioned that, through partnerships with other
NFT-related organisations, NFT's, native tokens and blockchains, that
the NFT-DAO will align itself with initiatives that favour cross-chain
and off-chain interoperability, for the purposes of growing the
micro-economy globally. In essence, a micro-economy allows for 1)
holistic tokenization across all asset classes (fungible and
non-fungible alike); 2) interoperability across all token platforms and
exchangeability across all asset classes; 3) the decentralised
distribution of royalties to all IP contributors (including the NFT-DAO
fees) through the automated triggering of smart contracts; 4) the
micro-accrual of NT's and NFT's for system users providing services to
other system users, to support the off-set of costs incurred within the
system; 5) Redistribution of a percentage of NFT-DAO fees back to the
community through incentives, recurring airdrops or instant dividend
payments.

It is of note that the size of the user-base in relation to the
frequency and volume of trading within the micro-economy will be such as
to create an opportunity for a passive income for token users (so long
as system users are providing value to the system. And by doing so, the
system reciprocates\* by adding value back in return). In theory, this
reciprocity of value and the decentralised deployment of dividends may
contribute to the global vision of a universal basic income (UBI).

\*When describing a 'reciprocal system' consider internet use. The user
gains value by using technology, viewing websites, online services and
media content for free (unless paid). In turn, the producer (i.e.,
hardware manufacturers, software developers, website owners, online
businesses or content creators) also gain value by having customer
interactions, be they paying, referring, building website traffic,
stress testing software, supporting ad revenue or increasing views and
channel engagement. A micro-economy would tokenise all of these
interactions so that every service rendered by the user to producers
provides micro-payments to the user; while every service rendered by the
producer to users provides micro-payments to the producer (where a
consensus on value is reached by users/producers within the system). The
degree to which a user/producer increases their token value within the
system is in direct proportion to how much value they provide other
user/producers. This value will not be determined through the
definitions of the person, by through the embedded definitions of their
interactions within the network.

As an open-source initiative, an initial IP proposal for consideration
is for the community to consider setting a precedent for how IP within
open-sourced projects (including DAO\'s/DCO\'s) might be managed.
Instead of using a Creative Commons licensing structure, which is
relevant for completed works, the community may consider how NFT\'s can
be applied to ideas-in-development (uncompleted works) though the
application of a Contribution Token, which may or may not align with the
tokenization of Voting, Governance or Equity sharing.

**Our Conclusion**

All 42 NFT-related proposals do not have a chance to be funded when
competing for a limited funding pool. Some ideas may have great
potential, but may be let down by poor proposal writing, lack of
feedback or lack in other areas. This project supports an amalgamation
of Catalyst\'s NFT community so that the skill-sets of the community can
be leveraged to deliver a more robust NFT framework for Cardano, for the
purposes of supporting an NFT economy. As a DAO, each NFT project stands
a greater chance of becoming a truly collaborative effort that will
benefit the wider Cardano community. It is envisioned that a Fund3
investment in this project will better position Cardano as the go-to
blockchain for NFTs (with lower gas fees) with many NFT-based point
solutions. Together we can become the de facto NFT blockchain of choice.

[]{#Appendix .anchor}**Appendix**

**WHAT IS AN NFT?**

Nonfungible.com describes \'Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) \[as\] unique,
digital items with blockchain-managed ownership. Examples of NFT
use-case includes collectables, game items, digital art, event tickets,
domain names, and ownership records for tangible assets. As of Oct, the
total NFT market volume reached \$134m with close to 5m sales. Other NFT
use-cases may include: \[CITE/TIDY\]

-   Physical art representation

-   Digital real estate

-   Tokenized real estate

-   Intellectual property

-   Warranties

-   Insurance

-   Badges

-   Certifications

This is just scratching the surface. NFTs allow for representation of
both digital and real-world value. Consider any unique asset (tangible
or intangible) to which a crypto-token can be attached to ensure
ownership, and that asset presents an NFT use-case. Because of the
staggering potential for this crypto-class to be developed on Cardano,
we believe it is important to build an infrastructure for unique asset
tokenization in an open-sourced and modular way so that all solution
contributors have the opportunity to monetize their unique
contributions.

As NFTs become ubiquitous, we need a system on Cardano that ensures
rapid development of emerging use cases, interoperability between all
parties and that supports Cardano to become the de facto choice to
launch NFT businesses.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) allow for representation of both digital and
real-world value. In fact, they blur the boundaries between digital and
physical. NFTs can represent tickets to an event, physical art, digital
art, in-game assets, badges, certifications and more... We\'re just
scratching the surface. As NFTs become ubiquitous on Cardano we\'ll need
patterns that ensure rapid development of emerging use cases and
interoperability between all parties.

**NFT PROPERTIES**

NFTs will be distinguished through a set of properties:

-   **Lifespan:** Different types of assets require different lengths of
    validity. For example, a sporting event ticket would need to be
    valid only after the conclusion of its corresponding event. IP
    ownership on the other hand would most likely be infinite until
    burned.

-   **Fractionality:** Some NFTs need to be whole, meaning 1 token = 1
    cryptokitty. On the other hand an NFT representing items of high
    value such as real estate could be fractional. See Cardano
    Multi-Asset Tokens Explainer

-   **Liquidity:** How often does asset exchange occur? Generally real
    estate changes hands less frequently than something like trading
    cards.

**ANALYSIS**

-   Moving toward a full DAO is a recurring point;

-   Providing Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) is a recurring point,
    though there was some discussion about the possibility of parts of
    the back-end being proprietary;

-   Staking native tokens is also a recurring point;

-   A system of values emerge from the discussions that include
    fairness, equity, shared governance, openness, transparency,
    emergent processes, freedom, iteration, collective intelligence,
    collectivism, rewarding contributions, effectiveness, inclusivity,
    resourcefulness and sustainability;

-   The need for further mapping around project phases and user flows
    was identified;

-   Discussions explored the idea of tiered/staged contributions
    regarding the distribution of tokens, voting power and rewards for
    varying degrees of community engagement and levels of expertise;

-   Of the DAO Models explored, a few offered DAO establishment as a
    paid service while others tended to customise their models off of
    existing ones. The two models that appear to resonate most with
    NFT-DAO is the Holonic Enterprise business model and the Distributed
    Cooperative Organisation (DCO) model;

-   A proposal discussed the establishment of a 'nomenclatured exchange
    that both buyers' and sellers' agents find attractive'. Benefits of
    this proposal included the creation of an agent-mediated
    listing-service based on real-estate and bartering models. Issues
    arising included the management of token proliferation, legalities
    and the desire to remove intermediaries from the transaction
    process;

-   Under the Tokenomics discussion, many points were made around the
    monetization of open-sourced contributions. These included loyalty
    programs, rollout of paid add-ons and support, transactions embedded
    in the smart contract, stake pools and developing additional paid
    services such as a token exchange;

-   Several questions were raised concerning token utility problems
    including the value and incentives for holding native tokens, lack
    of current rewards and alternative tokenization models (ie, NFT
    farming);

-   A range of tokenization models were explored (\@whitevo, \@Yagi,
    LiqwiDao, Compound, NFT-DAO business plan \@Troy) that explored
    token distribution, fee percentage splits, vote weightings, token
    utility, use-cases and tiered engagement;

-   General discussions were held about Voting and suggestions for how
    this might look, with the conclusion that progress toward a voting
    system needs to be implemented;

-   Finally, a range of questions were forwarded by contributors that
    inquired about consensus during early development, token
    distribution, the receipt of funds, the range of customisation
    available in marketplaces, the appeal of NT's versus ADA and
    tokenised staking in the DAO. It is envisoned that these are part of
    an ongoing dialogue that can be further explored in the Governance
    channels and recommendations section of this Update.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

GOVERNANCE: In the domain of DAO Governance, it is recommended that:

> DAO CONSTITUTION: The NFT-DAO embed its values within a founding
> document such as a Constitution;
>
> DECENTRALISATION ROADMAP: The NFT-DAO adds a phased Decentralisation
> roll-out into the DAO roadmap;
>
> HOLONIC ENTERPRISE (MACRO-SCALE): Since the NFT-DAO has been conceived
> as a holonic organisation from formation, it is recommended that the
> DAO employ a Holonic Enterprise business model on the macro scale. The
> implementation of this model should not alter the DAO's legal status;
>
> DISTRIBUTED COOPERATIVE MODEL (MICRO-SCALE): Since DAO's are
> technically founded on a machine-based consensus model, it is
> recommended that the NFT-DAO consider adopting a DCO model (as a
> trust-based DAO-variant) on the team-level, which fits into the
> Holonic Enterprise model with a focus on self-organising teams. The
> implementation of this model should not alter the DAO's legal status;

TOKEN HOLON: It is proposed that a Token Holon be formed to ideate and
build the financial tokenization strategy and its implementation in the
DAO. This Holon will support:

> TIERED ENGAGEMENT: The NFT-DAO explore a tokenisation strategy that
> considers a tiered rewards system based on degrees of member activity,
> skills and investment into the DAO;
>
> FOSS TOKENIZATION: It is recommended that further research be
> conducted that explores token or monetization models related to FOSS
> initiatives;
>
> TOKEN UTILITY: It is recommended that further research be conducted
> that explores token utility within the NFT-DAO and how this
> contributes to supporting social governance, engagement and rewarding
> contributions;
>
> DAO VOTING: It is proposed that consensus be sought on trialling a
> primary voting system (using a Discord Pollbot) until DAO governance
> tokens are minted;
>
> FINANCIAL SERVICES: The NFT-DAO secure financial expertise around
> tokenomics.

FUNDING: In the domain of DAO Funding, it is recommended that:

> LARGE FUNDS: The NFT-DAO apply for a large portion of Catalyst
> \"Startup\" funding with IOG/Cardano directly;
>
> STAKEPOOLS: The NFT-DAO set-up a stake-pool to build investment equity
> from DAO-network fees, beginning with a WYO Opportunity Zone proposal.

FURTHER RESEARCH: It is recommended that the NFT-DAO conduct further
research on:

> BUSINESS MODELS: Researching business models/organisations on the top
> tier of NFT/DAO platforms and how they are funded;
>
> SERVICE OFFERINGS: NFT-DAO engagement in further ideation/mapping and
> research around broader service offerings such as agents/traders, an
> NFT exchange, public education programs or Cardano business listings;
>
> STRATEGIC MAPPING: The NFT-DAO conduct further mindmaps/visualisations
> of ideas (including how BOXCAR users might create their own DAO).
