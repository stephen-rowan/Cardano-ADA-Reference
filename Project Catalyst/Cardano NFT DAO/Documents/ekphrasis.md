# ekphrasis
ekphrasis - rhetorical description of non fungible assets.

> "The word [ekphrasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekphrasis), or ecphrasis, comes from the Greek for the description of a work of art produced as a rhetorical exercise ... "The word comes from the Greek ἐκ ek and φράσις phrásis, 'out' and 'speak' respectively, and the verb ἐκφράζειν ekphrázein, "to proclaim or call an inanimate object by name""

In the Iliad, Vulcan the god of fire forges a Shield for Achilles. The Shield as well as having fungible value as armour also carries an immutable non-fungible record of the Greek civilisation that Achilles seeks to defend. This ekphrastic rhetoric is typically descriptive of a work of art but could be extended to any cultural object. The root of the term  ekphrasis means to "speak out" or "to proclaim or call an inanimate object by name". Therefore art criticism emerged as one form of rhetoric - that is, argument that ultimately depends upon eliciting an emotional response.

Ekphrasis emphasizes the subjective nature of art criticism or, indeed, any descriptive viewpoint. This is not to say that all meanings/values are relative - but rather that there is always a balance between meanings/values (moderate holism). There are also degrees of perspective - where similiar values group together (family resemblance) and subtly shift into incompatatible views (like a merkle-chain). Representation of such rhetorical families would have to allow for incompleteness (be paraconsistent) and change (even if ordered by a ledger). There may be some equivalence or common ground here with holonic theory. 


> "And Vulcan answered, "Take heart, and be no more disquieted about this matter; would that I could hide him from death's sight when his hour is come, so surely as I can find him armour that shall amaze the eyes of all who behold it."

> When he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turning them towards the fire and bidding them do their office. Twenty bellows blew upon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every kind, some fierce to help him when he had need of them, and others less strong as Vulcan willed it in the course of his work. He threw tough copper into the fire, and tin, with silver and gold; he set his great anvil on its block, and with one hand grasped his mighty hammer while he took the tongs in the other.

> First he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all over and binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three layers; and the baldric was made of silver. He made the shield in five thicknesses, and with many a wonder did his cunning hand enrich it.

> He wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at her full and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify the face of heaven- the Pleiads, the Hyads, huge Orion, and the Bear, which men also call the Wain and which turns round ever in one place, facing. Orion, and alone never dips into the stream of Oceanus."
