## An intial Metadata proposal

alessandro proposes a metadata standard ...

https://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-nft-metadata-standard/45687

> Tokens on Cardano are a part of the ledger. Unlike on Ethereum, where metadata can be attached to a token through a smart contract, this isn’t possible on Cardano because tokens are native and Cardano uses an UTxO ledger, which makes it hard to directly attach metadata to a token.
> 

Query : How will the Cardano smart contract upgrade affect this situation ? 

Query : Will not the Cardano computation layer (CCL) allow for unique token attachments with the Cardano settlement layer (CSL) ?


> Cardano has the ability to send metadata in a transaction, that’s the way we can create a link between a token and the metadata. To make the metadata unique to the token, they should be appended to the same transaction, where the token forge happens ..
