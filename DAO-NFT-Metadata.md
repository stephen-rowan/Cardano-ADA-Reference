# DAO NFT-Metadata

## The DAO NFT-Metadata github

https://github.com/NFT-DAO/NFT-Metadata


## An intial Metadata proposal

@alessandro [BERRY] proposes a metadata standard ...

https://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-nft-metadata-standard/45687

> @alessandro [BERRY] - Tokens on Cardano are a part of the ledger. Unlike on Ethereum, where metadata can be attached to a token through a smart contract, this isn’t possible on Cardano because tokens are native and Cardano uses an UTxO ledger, which makes it hard to directly attach metadata to a token.
> 

Query : How will the Cardano smart contract upgrade affect this situation ? 

Query : Will not the Cardano computation layer (CCL) allow for unique token attachments with the Cardano settlement layer (CSL) ?


> @alessandro [BERRY] - Cardano has the ability to send metadata in a transaction, that’s the way we can create a link between a token and the metadata. To make the metadata unique to the token, they should be appended to the same transaction, where the token forge happens ..

> @alessandro [BERRY] - a fully worked example of comprehensive JSON-LD Semantic Web/Metadata for digital archiving of photos see this little demo prototype from many years ago https://tgalib.github.io/ 

> Each page is rendered directly from the descriptive metadata see https://github.com/tgalib/ao-682b8dc3-1c9b-4752-96f4-97545f91be18/tree/archiveobject
