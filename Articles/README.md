> Cardano uses an innovative Extended UTXO accounting model to support multi-assets and smart contracts. In the first of a two-part blog, we look at the different blockchain accounting systems and why EUTXO matters

[Cardano’s Extended UTXO accounting model – built to support multi-assets and smart contracts (part 2)](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/12/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model-part-2/) -  Fernando Sanchez

> In the second part of our blog on Cardano’s EUTXO accounting model, we take a more technical look at transaction components, the UTXO set, and delve deeper into the rationale for Cardano’s EUTXO model
> 
> **Note**: These articles are a good overview of UTXO accounting models - but I was left wanting to know more detail about Cardano's accounting model. Particularly in the section "**How does the EUTXO model extend UTXO?**" it says "... EUTXO enables arbitrary logic in the form of scripts. This arbitrary logic inspects the transaction and the data to decide whether the transaction is allowed to use an input or not."
