# DAO NFT-Metadata

The Metadata thread (subject/section ?) of NFT DAO addresses xyz (a one or two sentence summary of this section). 

This is a very rough draft of how a standard README.md of a repository of the NFT DAO github might look to new vistors.

The only top-level file will be the README.md all other content will be in subject folders on this repository (reword).
