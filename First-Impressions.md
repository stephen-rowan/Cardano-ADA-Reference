## First Impressions

### An intial proposal

alessandro proposes a metadata standard ...

https://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-nft-metadata-standard/45687

> Tokens on Cardano are a part of the ledger. Unlike on Ethereum, where metadata can be attached to a token through a smart contract, this isnâ€™t possible on Cardano because tokens are native and Cardano uses an UTxO ledger, which makes it hard to directly attach metadata to a token.
> 

Query : How will the Cardano smart contract upgrade affect this situation ? 

Query : Will not the Cardano computation layer (CCL) allow for unique token attachments with the Cardano settlement layer (CSL) ?
